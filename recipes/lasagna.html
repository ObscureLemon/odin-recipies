	<p>This is the recipe for the best lasagna!<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
		<li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
		<li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
		<li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
		<li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
		<li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
		<li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
		<li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
